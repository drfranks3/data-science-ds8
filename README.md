# DATA 8 - Intro to Data Science - Spring 16

This is a collection of projects tasked to DATA 8 students in the Spring of 2016.

### Project 1: California Water Usage
This project analyzed water data obtained from the California State Water Resourced Control Board in conjunction with data on income from the Internal Revenue Service. After studying the datasets, we determined that *generally speaking* many ZIP codes on average that have a high income are located near the coast or by bodies of water, with some exceptions. Furthermore, we determined that In the Bay Area, people in the top 10 highest-income water districts used an average of **~24.6 more gallons of water** per person per day then people in other districts.

### Project 2: Classification
Project 2 enabled students to build a k-nearest-neighbors classifier, test and train data for usage in larger data sets, and understand the importance of features in large sets of data. This project additionally demonstrated the importance of recognizing how validation and accuracy come into play when determining what size `k` to use for a nearest-neighbors algorithm.

### Project 3: Inference
As mentioned in the project's description, we "investigated the relationship between murder and capital punishment in the United States." We defined the separation between correlation and causation, noting that whereas earlier in the project, we may have made the suggestion that the institution of the death penalty was a probably cause of murder rate fluctuation. Ultimately, we concluded that the death penalty is **not** an important factor in determining murder rate.

**This class was an incredibly warm welcome to the field of Data Science. Synthesizing programming with the analytical statistical methods, we learned how to analyze large sets of data—often many at the same time—in order to make a statement about the world.**
